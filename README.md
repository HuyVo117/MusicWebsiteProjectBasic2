# Technologies Used: MERN Stack

## 1.MongoDB:

Utilized as the primary database to store music tracks, user profiles, playlists, and other related data. Its document-oriented structure allows for flexible data representation, making it easy to manage complex data relationships.

## 2.Express:

Serves as the backend framework that handles API requests for features such as user authentication, song retrieval, and playlist management. Express simplifies routing and middleware integration, facilitating seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

## 3.React:

Powers the frontend of the music web application, allowing for the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces. React components enable users to browse songs, create playlists, and interact with the application in an intuitive manner.
